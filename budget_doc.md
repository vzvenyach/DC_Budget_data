#Schema for the JSON File

##Agency_Code
These are 3-character alphanumeric codes that represent individual agencies within the District Government. The first two characters are letters and the last character is always "0". The Council, for example, is AB0. The Housing Production Trust Fund, is UZ0.
[NB: In the FY13 data, there are sub-agencies that have a designation such as AE0-1, the Office of Labor Relations and Collective Bargaining. This is actually a program within the Office of the City Administrator and in the FY10-12 data, is represented as a Program. I haven't decided how to represent this.]
