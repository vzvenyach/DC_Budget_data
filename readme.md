#DC Budget Data
A small project that I am working on to practice using D3 and to open up some of the District's raw budget data.

#Nota Bene
There's a separate data file with some FY13 data that I'd like to import into the JSON file. I know I *could* do it using Excel as a CSV, but I may try and do it differently.
